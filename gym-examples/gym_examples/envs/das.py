All controller's method -> get_action(state) : should accept state
                                      state  : should include all sort of information 
                                      now 
                                      1) state information can be empty                                                   if state is empty -> control_acceleration = 0, control_heading = 0
        this tells me get state 
        should have a new state observation
        for static objects as well    2) state information can have static object(buildings)                if state only has static object -> control_acceleration = 0, control_heading = static_object_heading_control
                                      3) state information can have dynamic object(other uavs)
                                      4) state information can a both static and dynamic
